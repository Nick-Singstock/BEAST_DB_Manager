All needed files are included.

Run: 'sub_JDFTx.py -o Au_test' 
in this example folder to submit the 2-step Au bulk convergence.

The job will run until the energy convergence criteria is met,
job details will be output to 'opt.log' and 'out'.

Alternatively, after 'gc_manager.py -s True' is used to setup a folder, 
the Au POSCAR can be added to a new bulk folder and will be directly 
managed by the gc_manager.py script. 
1: Cp ./POSCAR path-to-gc-folder/calcs/bulks/Au/POSCAR
2: cd path-to-gc-folder
3: gc_manager.py -t 12
